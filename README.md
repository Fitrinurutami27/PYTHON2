##  Else After For
The else function after for is prioritized in search loops to provide a program exit.So, else after for is used to check whether the search or iteration was successful or not. This is a useful concept when you want to perform an action if the element you are looking for is not found in the loop.

## BREAK AND CONTINUE
break and contniue are two flow control statements used to control the behavior of loops.
  ### break :
  - break is used to forcibly stop the loop when a certain condition is met.
  - When break is executed, the program will exit the loop and continue executing the code after the loop.
  - This is very useful for stopping the loop when you have found the value or condition you are looking for without having to run the loop to completion.

  ### continue :
  - continue is used to proceed to the next iteration in the loop when certain conditions are met.
  - When continue is executed, the program will ignore the rest of the code in the current iteration and immediately proceed to the next iteration.
  - This is useful when you want to skip some iterations based on certain conditions without stopping the loop completely.

So, break is used to forcefully stop the loop, while continue is used to proceed to the next iteration in the loop without running the rest of the code in the current iteration.
