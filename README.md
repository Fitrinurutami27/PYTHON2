##  Else After For
The else function after for is prioritized in search loops to provide a program exit.So, else after for is used to check whether the search or iteration was successful or not. This is a useful concept when you want to perform an action if the element you are looking for is not found in the loop.

## BREAK AND CONTINUE
break and contniue are two flow control statements used to control the behavior of loops.
  ### break :
  - break is used to forcibly stop the loop when a certain condition is met.
  - When break is executed, the program will exit the loop and continue executing the code after the loop.
  - This is very useful for stopping the loop when you have found the value or condition you are looking for without having to run the loop to completion.

  ### continue :
  - continue is used to proceed to the next iteration in the loop when certain conditions are met.
  - When continue is executed, the program will ignore the rest of the code in the current iteration and immediately proceed to the next iteration.
  - This is useful when you want to skip some iterations based on certain conditions without stopping the loop completely.

So, break is used to forcefully stop the loop, while continue is used to proceed to the next iteration in the loop without running the rest of the code in the current iteration.
## WHILE
while is used to iterate or loop over a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. As long as the given condition is true, the code block in while will continue to be executed repeatedly.If at any time the condition is no longer true (False), then execution in the while will stop and the program will continue executing code after the while block.

## LIST COMPERHENSION
- LIST COMPERHENSION (create a list with in line loop and if). The thing that needs to be done first is to create a new list from the previous list operation.List   
  comperhension is a way to generate new lists based on previously existing lists or iterables.
- List comprehensions are used to create new lists by combining or manipulating elements of existing lists or by evaluating an expression.

## FUNCTION_CALL & RETURN_FUNCTION

FUNCTION CALL:
Function calling is how you invoke or "call" a previously defined function.In Python, calling a function is done by writing the name of the function, followed by parentheses, and possibly any necessary arguments within those parentheses.The calling function will run the code inside the function and can return a value if there is a return statement in it.

RETURN FUNCTION:
The return statement will make program execution exit the current function, while returning a certain value."return function" is not used in general. However, you can use functions to return the value (return value) of a function.This means that a function can perform certain calculations or tasks and then return the resulting value to its caller using the return statement.
